#Farmy

The name of my music mixer project is Farmy, it is easy to learn which makes it more confortable for the users when think about the app.

It will be an one page web where I will implement drag and drop functionality to load audio clips and create
a dynamic audio experience, trigger animation, and play a compiled audio track.

Create a UI with draggable sounds pieces; user drags each piece to a drop zone (Band) to create its own sound track. When the user choose a different band, the entire should reset with the new draggable sounds and leave the band empty.

Farmy Breakdown:
- User drags a sound piece from the bottom sound area to the drop zone and place it in one of the five characters(animals) in there.
-Each piece of sound will have a sign on it that users eventually will start to differentiate and match with each sound.
-Replay will have a reset button.
-Allow removing Sound pieces/drag back to the bottom? To be added later
